# Magnetic fields in heavy ion collisions using MCGlauber as a position generator
  We implement a code to evaluate the magnetic field in heavy ion collision using the free code MCGlauber, which is downloadable in this page: https://github.com/MCGlauber/. The MCGlauber is used to generate the positions of every proton inside the nuclei on each simulation. The code use the Lienard-Wichert equation to calculate the magnetic field with the consideration that the velocity of each proton is the same and is constant.
